# What is Space Spelling?

Wish you could improve you spelling skills?
But can't seem to recall that word you've studied a hundred times? 

Try using the "Space Spelling" app to memorize the most difficult words. 

Using the spaced repetition technique, you will be prompted to practice the words at intervals that guarantee memory retention.

When you get a word right, it appears less and less frequently. And if you get it wrong, youâ€™ll get more chances to practice and memorize it. 

This application is completely free and open source. Try it out today!
